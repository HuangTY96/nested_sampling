Nested Sampling
---------------

A python implementation of the nested sampling algorithm written by Stefano
Martiniani and Jacob Stevenson

This implementation uses the language of statistical mechanics (partition
function, phase space, configurations, energy, density of states) rather than
the language of bayesian sampling (likelihood, prior, evidence).  This is
simply for convenience, the method is the same.

See the examples for how to run the method
